# Simple Port Scanner 🔍

A basic Python port scanner I built as part of my cybersecurity practice.  
It scans a given target (IP/hostname) for open ports and also shows the common service name for each port.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Scan a target for open ports in a given range
- Shows the service running on the port (like SSH, HTTP, etc.)
- Option to scan your **local machine** directly with `local`
- Saves output in **results.txt**

---

## ⚡ Usage
```bash
python3 scanner.py <target/local> <start_port> <end_port>
